# Brighter, Darker, and FluentValidation

a project to explore usage of Brighter, Darker, and FluentValidation in asp.net core

My approach is to start with a standard asp.net core app with identity and try to refactor the AccountController to use Brighter for commands, Darker for Queries and FluentValidation to validate viewmodels.
